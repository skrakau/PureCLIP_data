# Simulated data (hg19)


BAM files

- Simulated mapped reads corresponding to mixture of target signal, background binding signal and random noise
- Contain dummy sequences, thus a realigning is currently not possible.


BED files

- Simulated (target-specific) crosslink sites and binding regions
- Note that the majority of the simulated sites are sparsely covered in the original RNA-seq data and consequently in the simulated iCLIP data, i.e. can likely not be detected.  

See https://github.com/skrakau/sim_iCLIP/wiki or 'Krakau S, Richard H, Marsico A: PureCLIP: Capturing target-specific protein-RNA interaction footprints from single-nucleotide CLIP-seq data.' for further details.
